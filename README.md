# FitBody – Mobile Fitness App User Journey Design

## Overview
FitBody is a conceptual mobile fitness application designed as part of a UI/UX design internship project at SkillCraft. The primary objective was to create a complete and seamless user journey for first-time users, covering every step from initial onboarding to accessing a personalized dashboard. The focus was on creating an engaging, intuitive, and user-centered onboarding process that encourages user commitment while collecting essential information to provide tailored recommendations.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to design a user flow that:
- Introduces users to the app’s benefits and core features.
- Collects key personal and fitness-related data in a structured, non-intrusive manner.
- Motivates users to begin their fitness journey with clarity and confidence.
- Provides a personalized dashboard and continuous engagement through tracking and community features.

## User Journey Flow
The FitBody app’s user journey was mapped and designed to include:

1. **Welcome and Onboarding**
   - A series of introductory screens highlighting fitness tracking, nutrition tips, and community support.
   - Clear navigation controls such as “Next” and “Skip” options for user flexibility.

2. **Account Creation and Access**
   - Sign-up and login functionality using email, mobile number, or third-party authentication.
   - Password recovery flow for secure and accessible account management.

3. **Profile Setup**
   - Input fields for essential personal details such as name, contact information, and profile preferences.
   - Minimal and clearly labeled forms to reduce cognitive load.

4. **Fitness Level Selection**
   - Categorization into Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced levels to guide workout recommendations.

5. **Goal Setting**
   - Options for weight loss, muscle gain, toning, or general fitness improvement.

6. **Physical Metrics Input**
   - Collection of height, weight, age, and gender for accurate customization.

7. **Motivational Transition**
   - Encouraging screen prompts to reinforce user dedication before proceeding to the main experience.

8. **Personalized Dashboard**
   - Displays workout plans, nutritional guides, challenges, and fitness-related articles.
   - Dynamic recommendations based on the user’s goals and profile data.

9. **Progress Tracking**
   - Interactive charts and logs for workouts and nutrition, allowing users to monitor improvements over time.

10. **Community Engagement**
    - Discussion forums and group challenges to promote social interaction, accountability, and long-term retention.

## Design Approach
The project followed a user-centered design methodology:
- **Clarity and Usability**: Simple layouts, clear typography, and intuitive navigation.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Presenting information in small, manageable steps.
- **Visual Consistency**: Branding, color palette, and UI elements kept uniform across screens.
- **Retention-Focused Features**: Progress tracking and community integration to maintain long-term engagement.

## Tools Used
- **Figma** – Wireframing and high-fidelity prototyping.

## Outcome
The final design delivers a cohesive and motivational onboarding flow that transitions seamlessly into a fully personalized dashboard. While the task required a low-fidelity clickable prototype, this project exceeded expectations by delivering a high-fidelity, visually polished user journey that aligns with modern mobile design standards.
